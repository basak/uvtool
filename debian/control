Description: Library and tools for using Ubuntu Cloud images
 This package provides tools, utilities and wrappers to make it easy to consume
 Ubuntu Cloud images. It is intended to support different subsystems such as
 libvirt and lxc. Use this package to pull in all the separate packages for
 all supported subsystems. This will configure all supported subsystems with
 sensible defaults. If you do not want this, consider installing the subsystem
 packages individually, instead.

Description: Library and tools for using Ubuntu Cloud Images with libvirt
 This package provides libvirt-specific tools for consuming Ubuntu Cloud
 images. Since it depends on libvirt-bin, installing this package will also
 install libvirt which by defaults configures it with a bridge on your system.
